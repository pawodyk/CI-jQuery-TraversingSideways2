# jQuery - Traversing DOM Sideways

## Instructions:

### **Challenge 2**

Return to the [cards page](https://github.com/pwodyk/CI-jQuery-temp_cards.git)

Give the paragraphs inside the cards a display: none;
Use slideDown to display the card paragraphs when the card_image is clicked.

### **Challenge 3**

When a card is clicked on, the background color is highlighted – e.g., set background-color to pink via adding a new class. When the card is clicked again, it is unhighlighted 

### **Challenge 4**

Add two more nav elements to the nav bar, select and all. When select is clicked, all panels disappear except those highlighted by clicking on them. It is a difficult challenge. Think about what is different about the highlighted panels. How could we select only those without the highlighting?
Then make all the panels reappear by clicking all.
A lot is going on here, but this combining of functions and selections is what makes jQuery so powerful. Take your time to understand what’s happening before moving on to the next section.
